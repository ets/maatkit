   * Handle malformed values that will return undef start and end points in
     chunking.
   * Updated documentation's example query to be run on the slave.

2007-07-10: version 1.1.9

   Changes:
   * Enabled chunking on FLOAT, DOUBLE and DECIMAL columns.

   Bugs fixed:

   * Documentation.
   * Support complex host definitions.

   * Added standard --version command-line option.

2007-06-03: version 1.1.6

   Incompatible changes:
   * The chunking functionality no longer guarantees chunks will be no larger
     than the specified size.  Use --chunksize-exact for that.  Note that the
     chunking functionality is still experimental and likely to change further.

   Changes:
   * Chunking now works with multiple-column indexes.
   * Added --quiet option, useful for cron jobs with --replicate.
   * Added --float-precision option; works around different floating-point formats.

   * Added error handling for tables that are dropped during checksumming.
   * Added documentation on the finer points of --replicate-do and --binlog-do.

   Bugs fixed:
   * There was a race condition between listing and checksumming tables.
   * Perl's auto-vivify hashes could cause all tables to be skipped after the
     first VIEW.
   * Some DBIs did not consider ? inside a comment to be a placeholder.
   * Systems that return nothing from CHECKSUM TABLE crashed mk-table-checksum.
   * --askpass did not print a newline after reading password.
   * Different TIMESTAMP display formatting could cause spurious checksum differences.

   * --replicate did not always work correctly with binlog_do_db.

2007-05-16: version 1.1.5

   Incompatible changes:
   * Output includes a new CHUNK column.
   * When using --replicate, the specified table structure needs a new 'chunk' column.

   Changes:
   * Added --chunksize and --chunkcol options to checksum tables in chunks.
   * Added --sleep option to pause between checksum queries.
   * Added --emptyrepltbl option to empty --replicate table before starting work.
   * Added --defaults-file option to read a given MySQL options file.
   * Check for existence of --replicate table before starting work.
   * Updated mk-checksum-filter to handle the new CHUNK column in the output.
   * More documentation.
   * More tests in the test suite.

   Bugs fixed:
   * The output in --replicate mode had an empty string in CHECKSUM when the
     table had no rows (bad for scriptability).
   * The --optxor optimization was broken and always disabled itself.

2007-05-05: version 1.1.0

   * Added a way to do checksums on slaves via replication.
   * Added a row-order-independent BIT_XOR checksum algorithm.
